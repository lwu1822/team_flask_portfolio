        <h1 class="text-primary">Our Aim</h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">
            We want to prioritize the customer before anything else; here's how this will be done:
            <br> 1. Our website will run smoothly with minimal errors
            <br> 2. Try to keep our website as engaging as possible
            <br> 3. Listen to reviews and make changes as necessary
            <br> 4. Make the results accurate
        </p>        
        <h1 class="text-primary">About the Project</h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">
            In this project, we are making a smaller version of an online dictionary. 
            Simply enter the word and the definition will show up, including the type of word, examples used in context, and the pronunciation (just like a real dictionary!).
            We also chose to a Word of the Day to give the project somehting interesting
        <h1 class="text-primary">How is This Done</h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">
           The point of the project was to learn about using APIs. 
           We used an API that contained the words and their definitons in the backend of our project 
           The project mainly uses HTML, Python, and Javascript 
           <br> 
           <br> 
           <br> 
           API used from rapidapi.com
